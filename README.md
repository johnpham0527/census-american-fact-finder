# census-american-fact-finder
This repository contains Python code that I have written to access the Census Bureau's American Fact Finder API to find demographic and other information. I wrote this script to learn more about Python's request and json libraries and the American Fact Finder API.

TO-DO
* Write a function that imports a list of Queens County ZIP Codes and outputs a file containing various demographic information such as poverty rate.

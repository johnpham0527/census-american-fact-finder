# census-american-fact-finder
This repository contains Python code that I have written to access the Census Bureau's American Fact Finder API to find demographic and other information. I wrote this script to learn more about Python's request and json libraries and the American Fact Finder API.

Known issues:
The CSV output file contains blank rows. I've used Excel to remove the blank rows
